# C - Pointers, arrays and strings
## Pointers
#### What are Pointers?
A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e.,
direct address of the memory location. Like any variable or constant, you must
declare a pointer before using it to store any variable address.

#### Arrays and Strings in C
Arrays are structured variables, where each element is stored consecutively in memory.
consecutively in memory.
Character strings are declared in C as character arrays and allow the use of a number of notations and special functions.

One-dimensional arrays
An array (one-dimensional, also called a vector) is a structured variable made up of a number of "n" characters.

In C there is no predefined type for manipulating strings. However,

A string in C is a one-dimensional array of characters (character vector) ending with the special character '\0'.
