# C - Pointers, arrays and strings
## Pointers
#### What are Pointers?
A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e.,
direct address of the memory location. Like any variable or constant, you must
declare a pointer before using it to store any variable address.

#### Arrays and Strings in C
Arrays are structured variables, where each element is stored consecutively in memory.
consecutively in memory.
Character strings are declared in C as character arrays and allow the use of a number of notations and special functions.

One-dimensional arrays
An array (one-dimensional, also called a vector) is a structured variable made up of a number of "n" characters.
of a number "n" of simple variables of the same type that are called the components or elements of the array.
the components or elements of the array. The number of components "n" is then the dimension of the array.

#### Character strings
In C there is no predefined type for manipulating strings. However,

A string in C is a one-dimensional array of characters (character vector) ending with the special character '\0'.

Tasks üìù
### Tarea 0 - 98 Battery st.
Write a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.
### Tarea 1 - Don't swap horses in crossing a stream
Write a function that swaps the values of two integers.
### Tarea 2 - This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read
Write a function that returns the length of a string.
### Tarea 3 - I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them
Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.
### Tarea 4 - I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear
Write a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.
### Tarea 5 - A good engineer thinks in reverse and asks himself about the stylistic consequences of the components and systems he proposes
Write a function that reverses a string.
### Tarea 6 - Half the lies they tell about me aren't true
Write a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.
### Tarea 7 - Winning is only half of it. Having fun is the other half
Write a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.
### Tarea 8 - Arrays are not pointers
Write a function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.
### Tarea 9 - strcpy
Write a function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.
### Tarea 10 - Great leaders are willing to sacrifice the numbers to save the people. Poor leaders sacrifice the people to save the numbers
Write a function that convert a string to an integer.
