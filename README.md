## General
+ Why C programming is awesome
+ Who invented C
+ Who are Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan and Linus Torvalds
+ What happens when you type gcc main.c
+ What is an entry point
+ What is main
+ How to print text using printf, puts and putchar How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator sizeof
+ How to compile using gcc
+ What is the default program name when compiling with gcc
+ What is the official C coding style and how to check your code with betty-style
+ How to find the right header to include in your source code when using a standard library function
+ How does the main function influence the return value of the program

## Requirements
### C
+ Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
+ All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
+ All your files should end with a new line
+ A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
+ A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, containing a description of the project
+ There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
+ You are not allowed to use system
+ Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
