# C, Hello World
## Resources
 +Everything you need to know to get started with C.pdf (You don't have to learn everything in it, but make sure you read the whole thing first)
+ Dennis Ritchie
+ C Programming Language Brian Kernighan
+ Why C programming is awesome
+ Learning to program in C part 1
+ Learning to program in C part 2
Understanding the C Program Compilation Process + Understanding the C Compilation Process
+ Betty's Coding Style
+ Hash-bang under the hood (Watch it only when you're done consuming the other resources)
+ Linus Torvalds on C vs. C++ (Watch only after you are done consuming the other resources)

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google.

## General
+ Why C programming is awesome
+ Who invented C
+ Who are Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan and Linus Torvalds
+ What happens when you type gcc main.c
+ What is an entry point
+ What is main
+ How to print text using printf, puts and putchar
How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator sizeof
+ How to compile using gcc
+ What is the default program name when compiling with gcc
+ What is the official C coding style and how to check your code with betty-style
+ How to find the right header to include in your source code when using a standard library function
+ How does the main function influence the return value of the program
## Requirements
### C
+ Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
+ All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
+ All your files should end with a new line
+ A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
+ A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, containing a description of the project
+ There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
+ You are not allowed to use system
+ Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

## Tasks üìù‚Ää‚Ää
### Task 0 - Preprocessor
Write a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.
### Task 1 - Compiler
Write a script that compiles a C file but does not link.
### Task 2 - Assembler
Write a script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.
### Task 3 -Name
 Write a script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun.
### Task 4 - Hello, puts
Write a C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.
### Task 5 - Hello, printf
Write a C program that prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,, followed by a new line.
### Task 6 - Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation
Write a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
